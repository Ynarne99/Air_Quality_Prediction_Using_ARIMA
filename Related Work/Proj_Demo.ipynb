        "1. Define the objective in business terms. \n",
        "The main goal is to predict the PM 2.5 levels in the air to determine the Air quality of Beijing. There are multiple datasets concerning different districts in Beijing. The data was recorded hourly for each district.Throughout, missing values have been filled as NaNs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when levels in air are high. PM2.5 are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main objective is to create a model based on the given data and determine which cities are more air polluted than the other and show the trend among different cities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How will your solution be used?\n",
        "The solution can be used to analyse the increse or decrease the trend of air quality among the cities and take appropriate measures in the cities where air quality is bad.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?\n",
        "Analyse the trend by training the model using different regression techniques such as Logistic regression and  SGD Regressor as the best optimization technique and the use SVM regreesor or any ML model to improve the results.\n",
